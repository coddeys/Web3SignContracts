## How It Works

Step 1: Connect your MetaMask wallet to the browser.

Step 2: Upload the PDF document to the browser's client-storage, IndexedDB.

Step 3: Sign the PDF document with your name.

Step 4: Input the MetaMask address of the other party involved.

Step 5: Use the Lit JS SDK to encrypt the document for secure sharing.

Step 6: Upload the encrypted document to IPFS using the Lighthouse JS SDK.

Step 7: Share the Content Identifier (CID) of the uploaded document with the other party.

Step 8: The other party repeats the process from Step 1 and shares the CID of the newly uploaded document with you.
